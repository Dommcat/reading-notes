# Class 7 Reading Notes: Programming with JavaScript

Summary: This class is about programming with Java Script. Include control flow which is the order the computer executes statements in a script, functions, operators.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses ().Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

Function Invocation: The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
-(when a user clicks a button)
-invoked (called) from JavaScript code
-automatically (self invoked)

Function Return:
-When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
-If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
-Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

The () Operator Invokes the Function

Operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Conditional Operators
Type Operators

The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /*â€¦*/ }.
