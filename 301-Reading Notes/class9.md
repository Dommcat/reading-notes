# 301 Reading Notes

## Class 9 Summary: This class is about Functional Programming

What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

What are the benefits of a pure function?
The code’s definitely easier to test.

What is immutability?
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

What is Referential transparency?
if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

What is a module?
another js function seperated

What does the word ‘require’ do?
function

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? path to module ('./')
