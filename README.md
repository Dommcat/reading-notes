#Codefellows 102 Reading Notes Journal


Hello. My name is *Dommcat* :cat: and I love **cats**. I have seven. 

A Growth Mindset to me is about setting and holding a positive intention for learning. All experience, even the kind that can sting, is positive - if you learn from it and move forward along the path.    

Three short reminders I use to hold a growth mindset are: 
- Be Positive 
- Be Helpful 
- Be Authentic 

Also, cats can help with improving the growth mindset. Try one (or seven) and see for yourself.
