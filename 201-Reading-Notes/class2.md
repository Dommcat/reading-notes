# 201 Class 02 Reading Notes

## Summary: This class is about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS

**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**
One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**
HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading.

**What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?**
The sup HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

**When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**
The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

**How CSS Is Structured**

**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**
An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet.

**Why should we avoid using inline styles?**
An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the HTML head
