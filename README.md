# 102 Reading Notes Journal

Hello. My name is *Dominick* and I love **cats**. I have seven.

A Growth Mindset to me is about setting and holding a positive intention for learning. All experience, even the kind that stings, is positive - if you learn from it - and move forward along the path.

Three short reminders I use to hold a growth mindset are:

- Be Positive
- Be Helpful
- Be Authentic

Also, cats can help with improving the growth mindset. Adopt a cat (or seven) and see for yourself.
