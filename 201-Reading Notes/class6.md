# 201 Reading Notes: Class 06

## Summary: This class is about Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

Bracket notation provides an alternative way to access object properties. Instead of using dot notation like this:
Object literals:

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document and the objects within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other APIs that add new features and capabilities to the DOM. For example, the HTML DOM API adds support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM, and the SVG API adds support for representing SVG documents.
