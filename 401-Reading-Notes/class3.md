- Summing Up: After seeing the difference between syntax errors and exceptions, you learned about various ways to raise, catch, and handle exceptions in Python. In this article, you saw the following options:

-*Raise* allows you to throw an exception at any time. 
-*Assert* enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.
-In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
-Except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
-Else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
-Finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
