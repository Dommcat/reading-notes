# Class 8 Reading Notes: Operators and Loops

Summary: This class is about expressions, operators, and loops. It's the mathy stuff along with the code that does shit.
This topic matters because its the nuts and bolts of software development and probably where the average human goes cross eyed. It's also where software developers get thier value.

Operators join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions. A complete and detailed list of operators and expressions is also available in the reference.

Key Areas of focus:

Comparison operators and Assignment operators:

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

Loops:

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
Key Areas of focus:

for statement and while statement loops:

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
