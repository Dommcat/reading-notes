# 401 Advanced Python: Class 42e Reading Notes

## Summary: This class reading is about: Ethics in Tech

**In the Microsoft and DoD situation**, I find myself siding with the Microsoft employees' ethical concerns about the potential militarization of their IVAS augmented vision technology and the Hololens. These tools, which were created to enhance human capabilities, seem to be at risk of being used as instruments of warfare, a purpose far from the creators' original intent. The tension between their creative goals and the company's potential deployment of their work for military use under the Department of Defense (DoD) contract is at the heart of the issue. I support the employees' stance against this contract as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing humanitarian and civilian applications of technology, rather than enabling warfare. The article also looks into the power dynamics within corporations like Microsoft, pointing out a possible disconnect between the employees' interests and those of the leadership and shareholders. This raises critical questions about the roles and rights of employees in influencing corporate decisions, particularly when ethical issues are at stake. Should employees have a say in the application of their work, or should these decisions be solely under the control of the company's leadership and shareholders? The fairness and sustainability of this model are worth questioning. In summary, this article sparks important reflections on the ethical implications and power structures in the evolving tech landscape.


**Amazon does too much**, When ethics, technology, and policy mix together, things can get pretty complicated, especially when companies partner up with government agencies. This basically turns these companies into extensions of the government, which is pretty concerning considering how fast technology is advancing. We hope that tech can help lift marginalized communities up, but I'm getting more and more worried that it might actually push them further down. Just look at the report from the ACLU that exposed a company selling AWS Rekognition, a super powerful facial recognition technology, to police departments and government agencies. This kind of tech, which started off with good intentions, could end up being used in ways that invade people's privacy and civil liberties. It could be misused to target certain communities unfairly, leading to over-the-top surveillance and intrusion. This whole situation shows just how important it is to think about the ethics behind the technology we create. It's important to make sure these technologies are used responsibly and have strong checks and balances to stop any abuse. As tech keeps on evolving, we need to keep the ethical side of things front and center in our conversations.
