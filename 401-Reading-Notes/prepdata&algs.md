# 401 Class 1 Reading Notes

## Readings Summary: This class is about: Data Structures and Algorithims (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms (often referred to as DSA) are fundamental principles in computer science. Throughout this course, you will be given new code challenges and will be required to whiteboard out the solution as well as implement a code solution.

-When deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem, one of the more important factors to consider is the time complexity of the operations you'll be performing most frequently. Different data structures have varying performance characteristics for common operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and updating. You should choose a data structure that optimizes the performance of the most critical operations for your specific problem. For example, if you need fast lookups and insertion, a hash table might be a good choice. If you need to maintain a sorted collection of items with fast insertions and deletions, a balanced search tree might be more appropriate.

-To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you should ensure that you have a well-defined base case or stopping condition in your recursive function. A base case is a simple condition that, when met, returns a value without making any more recursive calls. This helps prevent infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow. Additionally, you can use techniques like memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant recursive calls. This can help optimize recursive functions and reduce the risk of call stack overflows.
