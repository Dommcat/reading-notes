# Class 6 Reading Notes: Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

Summary: This class is about the programming language Java Script and its ability to make computers do thier thing. Like be interactive dynamic machines.

What is JS?

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.

Key Notes of interest:

- Most well known environment to run JavaScript on the server is Node.js
- alert - This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text.
- document.write function used to change the content of the page.
- console.log: used for to print out debugging information.

Prompt: The first one is called prompt. It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function. Then, in this example we use the document.write method to update the html with the text.

Confirm: The other pop-up is not really an input method. It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses OK the confirm() function will return true, if the user presses cancel or hits the ESC key, the function will return false.

4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing

Side Note: I'm old. declare syntax let and const were added in 2015. Back in my early analyst days days (years before then) it was VAR to declare. Not sure I can break the habit.
