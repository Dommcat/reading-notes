# 401 Class 16 Reading Notes

## Summary: This class is about Serverless Functions

*Serverless* is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

API stands for application programming interface. In essence, an API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what each other does.
