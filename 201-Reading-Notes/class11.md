# 201 Reading Notes: Class 11

## Summary: Audio, Video, Images

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video> element.
Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video> element?
Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.

The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight.

## src

In the same way as for the img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column.
