Codefellows 102 Reading Notes Journal


Hello. My name is *Dommcat* and I love **cats**. I have seven. 

A Growth Mindset to me is about setting and holding a positive intetntion for learning. All experience, even the kind that stings, is positive - if it moves one forward along the learning path.    

Three short reminders I use to hold a growth mindset are: 

1) Be Positive 
2) Be Helpful 
3) Be Authentic 

Also, cats help with improving the growth mindset. Try one (or Seven) and see for yourself.
